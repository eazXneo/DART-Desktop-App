Graphical User Interface for the Deep Approximation for Retinal Traits (DART) codebase. 

From the [DART repository](https://github.com/justinengelmann/DART_retinal_fractal_dimension): "DART (Deep Approximation of Retinal Traits) allows to compute retinal traits very quickly (200-1,000 img/s on a single machine) and in a way that is more robust to image quality issues." The user interface was developed to allow for easy setup and usage of DART by bypassing the need for installing python, pytorch and various dependencies as well as basic knowledge of using the command line to enter parameters.

## Quick start

### Details 
The interface itself was developed using tkinter following Object-Oriented Programming practices. tkinter was chosen due to its relative simplicity as a framework and easy to learn.
